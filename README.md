# ENTNT Technical Assignment: Calendar Application for Communication Tracking

This project is a React-based calendar application designed to help companies maintain and track their communication with other organizations. It provides a centralized platform to log past interactions, schedule future communications, and ensure follow-ups are timely and consistent. The app is divided into three core modules:

#### Admin Module:
Allows administrators to configure the system by managing companies, communication methods, and communication periodicity settings.

#### User Module:
Provides end-users with an interactive dashboard to view and manage communications with companies. Users can log new interactions, view overdue or upcoming communications, and get notified of tasks due today.

#### Reporting and Analytics Module :
Offers actionable insights such as communication frequency reports, engagement effectiveness, overdue communication trends, and downloadable reports.


#### The app emphasizes usability, clear data visualization, and efficient communication tracking to improve relationship management across organizations.
